   - [0/0] overview

     - [ ] demo a/ document VM early provisioning w/ Salt (if possible)
   - Questions
     - Q: in Salt's YAML, to set a line as a comment, does the HASH need to be in the first space or simply the first non-whitespace char
       - TABs in the first space are illegal
       - A: looks like, as long as the comment-HASH isn't preceeded by
         a TAB, (which is always illegal during parsing), the HASH
         symbol can be anywhere on the line
         - this means any indentation of line can be commented in any way desired as long as it doesn't involve any TABs to the left of the HASH mark
         - TABs after the HASH are always OK
   - log
     - [2015-02-13 Fri]
       - [ ] bug: configs in =./etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d= are not read 
         - doesn't respect symlinks, though hardlinks are ok
         - doesn't respect 'conf.*' config, must be '*.conf'
         - this is a problem for me because it breaks my config convention

*** enhancement requests: Salt States a/o Related Content Areas
***** REPORTED create state to disable password logins, allowing only pubkey auth
***** REPORTED create script to auto-deploy configs required for salt clients
***** REPORTED disable screensavers for VDI servers
***** REPORTED add git-gui to the start menu
***** REPORTED detect VDI role, if a server is primarily accessed via VDI
